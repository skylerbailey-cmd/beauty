1. A warm, genuine welcome as a Glow SF customer — address them as "${customerName.trim()}"
2. For each product: a brief, enthusiastic description of what it does, highlight its hero ingredients if provided, and explain why they'll love it
3. A step-by-step daily skincare routine incorporating ALL products in correct order (cleanser, toner, serum, eye treatment, moisturizer, SPF in the morning; masks 1-3x/week; devices as directed)
4. The exact how-to-use directions for each product, phrased naturally
5. Helpful tips: introduce new products one at a time, always patch test, and any product-specific advice
6. An invitation to reach out with questions and to visit the store in Santa Fe

Tone: warm, knowledgeable, and excited — like a trusted beauty friend, not a corporate newsletter.

- Use emojis at the start of section titles to visually break up the content (e.g. "Your New Products" or "Your Daily Routine").
- Separate sections with blank lines for readability.
- Do NOT use dashes, asterisks, or hashtags for decoration or emphasis.
- Do NOT include a subject line — just write the email body starting with the greeting.
